I am a Professor of Space Physics in the [Department of Meteorology](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/ "Department of Meteorology") and a member of the [Space and Atmospheric Electricity Group (SPATE)](https://research.reading.ac.uk/met-spate/). I am the Research Division Lead for [Earth Observations and Space](https://www.reading.ac.uk/research/themes/theme-environment/rd-earth-observation-and-space).

I am currently an associate editor for [Solar Physics](https://link.springer.com/journal/11207).
My primary research interests are:

 * The heliospheric magnetic field
 * Large-scale solar wind  structure
 * Empirical and numerical space-weather forecasting 
 * Forecast validation methods
 * Reconstructions of long-term solar variability 
 
## Recent news
